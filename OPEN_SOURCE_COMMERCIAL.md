# Open Source & Commercial Use

CDI Guardrail is **fully open source** by design.

This document explains:
- what is free
- what is paid
- why organizations engage us even though the code is public

There is no feature gating and no hidden components.

---

## What is open source (and always will be)

The repository provides, at no cost:

- The CDI methodology and implementation
- Fast and full CDI computation paths
- Calibration logic
- Monitoring and drift detection
- Logging and Prometheus integration
- Tests and examples

Teams are free to:
- run the library internally
- modify it
- audit the code
- generate their own metrics and artifacts

Transparency is intentional.

---

## What we do *not* sell

We do **not** sell:
- access to code
- proprietary algorithms
- dashboards or hosted services
- licenses to use CDI
- “enterprise features” hidden behind a paywall

If you only need software, the open-source project is sufficient.

---

## Why organizations still engage us

When models are reviewed by:
- internal risk committees
- compliance teams
- external auditors
- regulators
- legal counsel

the question is not:

> “Can this tool run?”

The question is:

> **“Can this evidence be defended?”**

Open source software provides **capability**.  
It does not provide **authority, interpretation, or accountability**.

---

## The paid outcome: risk evidence, not software

Organizations typically engage us to produce or support a:

**Time-Bounded Model Risk Evidence Report**

This is a frozen, scoped artifact that documents:
- how a specific model behaved
- under a defined policy
- over a specific time window
- using transparent methodology

The value is not the numbers alone.

The value is:
- correct application of the methodology
- interpretation of results
- clearly stated assumptions and limitations
- defensible narrative suitable for audit or incident response
- a human party accountable for the analysis

---

## When teams usually contact us

Teams most often reach out when:

- an incident has occurred and behavior must be explained
- a model is under regulatory or internal review
- leadership requests defensible evidence, not dashboards
- a deployment decision needs documented risk justification
- an audit requires a clear, time-bounded snapshot

These situations involve **external pressure** and **real consequences**.

---

## How engagement typically works (high level)

A typical engagement involves:
- reviewing model and policy context
- calibrating CDI thresholds appropriately
- selecting defensible analysis windows
- generating a structured risk evidence report
- walking stakeholders through interpretation and limits

The output is an artifact that can be archived, cited, and defended.

---

## Why this is compatible with open source

Keeping the system open:
- increases trust
- reduces procurement friction
- allows independent verification
- strengthens the defensibility of the evidence

We do not rely on secrecy.  
We rely on **correct application and accountable interpretation**.

---

## Summary

- **The software is open.**
- **The methodology is transparent.**
- **The paid value is professional risk evidence.**

If your organization needs answers it can confidently stand behind,  
that is where engagement makes sense.

### Status

This document describes intent, not obligation.  
Using the open-source library does not require any commercial relationship.
